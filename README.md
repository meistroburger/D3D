# D3D FPS Game

This repository contains a minimal first-person shooter written in TypeScript using [Three.js](https://threejs.org/). The project is inspired by open-source releases of classic games such as **Doom** and **GTA**, but it does not reuse their source code.

## Getting Started

Make sure you have Node.js installed. To run the game locally, install dependencies and start the development server:

```bash
cd fps-game
npm install
npm run start
```

Then open <http://localhost:1234> in your browser. Click anywhere on the page to lock the pointer and use **WASD** keys to move.

Use `npm run build` to create a production build.
